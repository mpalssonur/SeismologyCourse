\section*{Problem 1}
Period $T$ is to angular frequency $\omega$ as wavelength is to: 

(a) wavenumber k, 

(b) velocity c, 

(c) frequency f , 

(d) time t, 

(e) none of the above

\subsection*{Solution}

$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ and $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ so the answer is (a), the wavenumber.
